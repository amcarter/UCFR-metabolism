UCFR todo:

Figures:
	- edit so all are consistent site names/placement ect.
	1. incorporate site abbreviations in all.
	2. add site names and P:R ratios (1.12 +- 0.3 to each panel. add info to caption.
	3. Put the panel letter labels in parentheses, name axes algal biomass standing crop and chla standing crop. make both end at 100. remove underscore from legend.
4. see bob's written comments.
	make all panel labels consistent
change GPP and ER to P and R
 
Methods:
	- go through Maury's document of conventions, etc.
-find the units for light

Results
- march through the results sequentially
1) average C flux
2) cumulative flux for fil and for epi
3) even during blooms, did cumulative flux was less than the average epi flux 
4) epi = 29% of standing crop but 72% of prod
5) results in very different turnover times

Writing:
- new title
- what to do about theory in the introduction?
- find fluxnet paper to cite
	- check maury's paragraph on UCFR for previous pubication
- change turnover time to residence time (or vise versa)
- edit introduction
- add information about discharge by depth relationship to metabolism extimation section
- shorten/tighten metabolism estimation section.
	- move GAM code to SI
- sufficiently link the site to site differences in fiGs 2-3 to the contents of figs 4-6.
- add in P:R and ER x GPP correlation To the results.

check whole document:
- no repeated acronym definitions
- all acronyms are defined
- all results are in past tense
- all figures are in order
- don't present data without a reference to a figure or a table
- don't provide material in the figures that isn't referenced in the text
- no methods statements in the results
- consistency with variable names and units
