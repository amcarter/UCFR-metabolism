- determine if gamma fit is better than linear
- rerun model fits accordingly
- recode models to all be timeseries hypotheses
- code in stan to include biomass sampler
- look at the residuals through time

WRITING
- Write up methods:
	- fitting GAMS
	- fitting stan models
- Write up results including:
	- comparison of Chla and biomass models
