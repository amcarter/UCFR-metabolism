UCFR todo:

DATA ANALYSIS
- evaluate metabolism fit (and make SI plots)
    - look at K600 over time
    - compare 2020 and 2021 fits (K/Q)
    - rerun with removed days if necessary
- fit biomass x chl a relationship with standardized axis regression
- Compare cumulative GPP to biomass (maybe...)
-make plot of metabolism for publication

FIT GAMS
- clean up GAMs plots for publication

FIT MODELS
- code in stan to include biomass sampler
- look at the residuals through time

DATA CLEANING
- figure out where the field notes are
- look to see when the last time the sensors were visited.
- revisit DO data with field notes
- ask matt about field notes

WRITING
- Make storyboard
- Write up methods:
	- fitting GAMS
	- fitting stan models
- Write up results including:
	- comparison of Chla and biomass models
